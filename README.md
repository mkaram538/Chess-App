# Chess-App
This is a future project that will have a python backend and swift front end.

This project is one of the first independent project ideas that I had in my freshman year. During that time, I did not manage to finish the project. 
Now, as a junior, I am hoping to pick this project back up as a way to gain a deeper understanding of Python and learn Swift as a tool for mobil development.
